# DSP-RWTH_DemoProject
The DSP-RWTH Demo is a multi-platform application designed to showcase a virtual
3D grid of lockers that can be interacted with across various devices. Specifically
tailored for mobile, PC, and HoloLens platforms, this system offers a consistent user
experience regardless of the device in use.
Upon launching the demo, users are greeted with a 5x3 grid of lockers, each
equipped with interactive doors that can be opened or closed. This entire grid is
placed on a rotatable platform. With a UI knob, users can adjust the platform's
orientation, providing different viewpoints of the locker structure. Additionally, a reset
function is available to revert all the lockers and the platform to their initial positions.
Under the hood, the DSP-RWTH Demo utilizes an adaptable control system.
Depending on the active platform, it dynamically adjusts the interaction method,
whether that's a tap on mobile, a mouse click on PC, or a gesture or touch on
HoloLens.
